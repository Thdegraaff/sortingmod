# Overview

sortingmod is a package for estimating the sorting model - a discrete choice model which explains the location decision of heterogeneous individuals over a set of alternative locations. The model is developed by Bayer et al. (2004) following the work of Berry et al. (1995). It relies on the assumptions that individuals choose a location that maximizes their utility, and that heterogeneous individuals with different characteristics have different preferences, and different valuation for location characteristics. The results of the model provide choice probabilities for each alternative, as well as insight on the valuation patterns of heterogeneous agents, and marginal willingness-to-pay values for location characteristics.

The package is constructed as an accompanying tool for the Summer School in “Hedonic price analysis and the residential location choice”, hosted by the Kraks Fond - Institute for Urban Economic Research (Copenhagen, Denmark).
